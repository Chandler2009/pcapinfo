# pcapinfo

This was a one shot project. The goal was to write a small tool to play with libpcap and implement a small thread pool.

Feel free to start from here, the playing with the packet part happens in src/pcapinfo.c:81:_analyze_packet.

I was developing from my Mac but also wanted it to compile on Linux boxes.

All comments welcome :)
